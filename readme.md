Convert Images to CSS Box Shadow with Node
==========================================

after fulfilling my goal I decided to stop here and not continue to develop it, anyway ... is kinda useless lol  

the file path is inside the image2css.coffee and is currently fixed :)  

larger images may need different options, because the browser will suffer to render all those box shadows
